title: Problem 3. (±)-Coerulescine
order: 1
---

A spiro compound is typically an organic compound containing rings linked together by one common atom (spiroatom) as carbon atom with bold in figure below. The spiro[pyrrolidin-3,3′-oxindole] ring system is a structural framework incorporated in several cytostatic alkaloids and unnatural compounds. Coerulescine (**1**) and horsfiline are the simplest prototype members of this subfamily that can be synthesized by the route shown below.

Claisen rearrangement, which is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, is a powerful carbon--carbon bond-forming reaction in which an allyl vinyl ether is converted thermally to an unsaturated carbonyl compound as shown in the Scheme below. When compound **A** is heated, it undergoes Claisen rearrangement to give carbonyl compound **B**.

**For this entire task, your answers can be given without any stereochemical details.**

**3.1. Draw** the structures of **A** and **B**.

- **A** is an inseparable mixture of *cis/trans* isomers.

- **B** has IR absorption at 1726 $cm^{-1}$

**3.2.** **Draw** structures for **C**, **D**, **E**, and **F**.  

- **D**--**F** have a bicyclic structure.

**3.3.** **Choose** the correct order of steps  for the transformation of **F** to **G**.

**3.4.** **Draw** structures for **G** and **H** (both spiro compounds).

**3.5.** **Draw** the structure of the intermediate produced by treatment with *n*-BuLi in the step **H → coerulescine (1)**.

**Coerulescine (1)**, on treatment with *N*-bromosuccinimide (NBS), gives the bromo derivative, which upon heating with sodium methoxide in the presence of cuprous iodide gives **horsfiline** (**I**) in 60% yield.

**3.6.** **Choose** the correct structure for compound **I** consistent with the following selected ${}^{1}$-NMR data: δ  7.05 (d, *J* = 1.4 Hz, 1H), 6.78 (d, *J* = 8.0 Hz, 1H), 6.72 (dd, *J* = 8.0, 1.4 Hz, 1H) ppm.
