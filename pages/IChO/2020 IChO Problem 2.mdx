title: Problem 2. A Tale of a Reactive Intermediate 
order: 2
---

Arynes constitute a special class of reactive intermediates. The first experimental evidence for the structure of an aryne (benzyne) was demonstrated in 1953 via the elegant labeling experiments by John D. Roberts and coworkers.

In one such experiment, chlorobenzene, whose carbon at position 1 was labeled with radioactive ${}^{14}$C, was reacted with $KNH_{2}$ in liquid $NH_{3}$ to give nearly equal amounts of isotopic isomers **A** and **B** along with the inorganic salt **C**. This reaction proceeds via the formation of aryne intermediate **D**.

**2.1.** **Draw** the structure of **A**, **B** and **D**, and provide the formula of **C**. Indicate the position(s) of ${}^{14}$C-labeled carbon(s) with an asterisk (\*) whenever applicable.

Analysis of the ${}^{14}$C-labeled product(s) was achieved via degradation experiments (the ${}^{14}$C-labeled carbons are not shown on the structures). Radioactivities of the intermediates and final products were examined.

**2.2.** **Tick** the appropriate boxes on the answer sheet for the intermediates and products that you expect to exhibit radioactivity.

With the aim of facilitating aryne formation, Kobayashi and co-workers developed a fluoride-induced aryne generation protocol. Using this method, benzene derivative **3** is reacted with furan ( **4** ) in the presence of CsF, resulting in the formation of **E** , **F** , and **G**.

- Combustion analysis of **E** revealed the following atom content: 75.8% carbon, 5.8% hydrogen, and 18.4% oxygen.
- **E** does not have a proton that is exchangeable with $D_{2}O$ in 1H-NMR spectroscopy.
- **F** is an ionic compound.

**2.3.**  **Determine** the structures of **E** , **F** , and **G** (without stereochemical details).

In the absence of a nucleophile or a trapping agent, arynes can undergo [2+2]-type cyclodimerization or [2+2+2]-type cyclotrimerization reactions under suitable conditions. The aryne derivative that is obtained when **3** is treated with one equivalent of CsF in MeCN can give, in principle, four different dimerization and trimerization products ( **H** – **K** ).

- **H** has two planes of symmetry.
- **I** is expected to exhibit 21 signals in its 13C-NMR spectrum.
- **I** and **J** both exhibit an _m/z_ value of 318.1 in their mass spectra.

**2.4.**  **Determine** the structures of **H** – **K**.

When **5** is reacted with _β_-ketoester **6** in the presence of 2 equivalents of CsF at 80 °C, **L** is obtained as the major product. The ${}^{1}$H-NMR and  ${}^{13}$C-NMR data for **L** , in $CDC_{l3}$, are as follows:

- ${}^{1}$H-NMR-NMR: δ 7.79 (dd, _J_ = 7.6, 1.5 Hz, 1H), 7.47–7.33 (m, 2H), 7.25–7.20 (m, 1H), 3.91 (s, 2H), 3.66 (s, 3H), 2.56 (s, 3H) ppm.

- ${}^{13}$C-NMR-NMR: δ 201.3, 172.0, 137.1, 134.4, 132.8, 132.1, 130.1, 127.5, 51.9, 40.2, 28.8 ppm.

**2.5.** **Determine** the structure of **L**.

**2.6.** In the reaction shown in task **2.5** , which of the statement(s) in the answer sheet describe(s) the function of CsF?

- The $pK_{a}$ values of HF and _β_-ketoester **6** in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are about 15 and 14, respectively.

Diazapyrone derivative **8** was shown to be a useful reactant for the construction of a variety of cyclic frameworks. Its preparation from phenylglyoxylic acid ( **7** ) and its use in two different reactions are described below.

- **Q** and **T** are gases under ambient conditions.
- **O** and **P** are constitutional isomers.
- **Q** does not have any signals in its IR spectrum.
- Heating 1 mol of **R** at 85°C generates 1 mol of reactive intermediate **S**.
- Reaction of **8** with two equivalents of **S** gives **U** , **Q** , and **T**.

**Note:**
