There are numerous reactions in organic chemistry that proceed through cyclic transition states and these are classified as pericyclic reactions. Woodward-Hoffmann rules, developed by Robert B. Woodward and Roald Hoffmann, are used to rationalize stereochemical aspects and the activation energy of pericyclic reactions.

**4.1. Fill** in the table for reactions (**i**)-(**iii**) or products **2**-**5**:

There are three possible benzotropone isomers. Although two of the benzotropone isomers were isolated, 3,4-benzotropone (**1**) has not been isolated. Its instability is attributed to the *o*-quinoidal structure of **1** because it has no sextet electron system in the benzene ring.

**4.2. Draw** the structures of stable benzotropone isomers **A** (with 6 signals in its ${}^{13}$C-NMR) and **B** (with 11 signals in its ${}^{1}$H-NMR).

**4.3.** When the following tetraene is reacted under photochemical conditions, symmetry-allowed product(s) of three different ring sizes can form according to the Woodward--Hoffmann rules. **Tick** the correct answer in each row.

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2015 was awarded jointly to the Turkish scientist Aziz Sancar, Swedish scientist Tomas Lindahl, and American scientist Paul Modrich for their "mechanistic studies of DNA repair". Pyrimidine bases found in DNA may undergo a photochemical **[2+2]-cycloaddition reaction** (see above figure) with UV light that reaches a person's skin, causing damage to DNA, which may ultimately lead to skin cancer. The research by Professor Aziz Sancar focused on the DNA repair mechanism for this type of damage.

Thymine (**T**) is one of the nucleobases that can undergo such a photochemical reaction with UV light. Let us assume that we have a solution of free thymine that was subjected to UV irradiation.

**4.4.** Considering stereochemistry, **draw** the structures of **all possible products** of this reaction between two free thymine (**T**) molecules. **Circle** the compound(s) which is/are chiral. Drawing only one enantiomer of an enantiomeric pair is sufficient. Please note that only C=C bonds participate in this reaction.

A broad range of halogenated derivatives of norbornadiene (**N**) are known in the literature. Tribromo-norbornadiene (C~7~H~5~Br~3~)  has six achiral isomers. Three of these isomers (**6**, **7**, and **8**) are given below.

**4.5.** How many signals do you expect from the ${}{1}$-NMR spectra of **6**, **7**,and **8**? **Fill in** the following boxes.

**4.6**. **Draw** structures of the remaining achiral tribromo-norbornadiene ($C_{7}H_{5}Br_{3}$) isomers (**C**, **D**, and **E**) in addition to **6**--**8** over the given figures in the boxes.

The NMR spectrum of ether **9** is complex. Two MeO-- groups are different as are all the hydrogen atoms on the rings. However, diphenol **10** has a very simple NMR spectrum and there are only three types of protons (marked as a, b, and c). A reasonable average structure responsible for all resonance structures and its symmetry is shown as **11**.

**4.7**. How many signals do you expect from the ${}^{13}$C- and ${}^{1}$H-NMR spectra of **12** and **13**?
